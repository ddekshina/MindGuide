# ðŸ§  MindGuide

**MindGuide** is an AI-powered decision-making assistant that helps users with personal and professional growth through guided conversations.

## How It Works

**Initial Question:** The application starts with a general question about the user's area of focus.
**Conversation Flow:**
1. User responds to questions
2. Responses are sent to the Gemini API
3. The API generates the next relevant question
4. After 5 exchanges, a final recommendation is generated


**Decision Output:** The application displays a personalized recommendation with action steps and relevant resources.
